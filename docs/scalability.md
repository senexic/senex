# Scalability & Performance

## Computational Distribution

### On-Chain Operations
- Smart contract coordination and validation
- Token transactions and governance voting
- Proof verification and state updates

### Off-Chain Computation
- Heavy AI inference on validator nodes
- Secure multi-party computation for aggregation
- IPFS storage for model weights and datasets

## Performance Targets
- 1M+ concurrent [AIA agents](architecture/aia_agents.md) supported
- Sub-second response times for simple queries
- 99.9% uptime with Byzantine fault tolerance
- Linear scaling with validator network growth
