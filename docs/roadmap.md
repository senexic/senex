# Roadmap & Deployment Strategy

## Phase 1: Private Node Network (6 months)
- Deploy [AIA agents](architecture/aia_agents.md) on controlled devices
- Implement core [smart contracts](architecture/intelligent_chain.md) on Polygon testnet
- Establish initial validator network (10-50 nodes)
- Test privacy-preserving aggregation protocols

## Phase 2: Public Testnet (6 months)
- Open [AIA agent](architecture/aia_agents.md) beta to public participants
- Deploy full smart contract suite on Polygon mainnet
- Scale to 100+ validator nodes
- Launch token distribution and staking mechanisms

## Phase 3: Production Mainnet (12 months)
- Full production deployment with all features
- Migration planning for custom Layer 1
- Implement advanced privacy features (homomorphic encryption)
- Scale to global user base (1M+ agents)

## Phase 4: Custom Layer 1 Migration (ongoing)
- Deploy [SENEX Intelligent Chain](architecture/intelligent_chain.md)
- Proof-of-Contribution consensus implementation
- Enhanced AI-optimized blockchain features
- Complete decentralization of governance
