# System Architecture Overview

## 1.1 Core Components

The SENEX Intelligent Chain ecosystem is built upon three integrated pillars that function in harmony to create a decentralized, privacy-preserving AI network.

### Component Interaction

The system operates through a continuous feedback loop:
1. **[AIA Agents](aia_agents.md)** collect and process local data, submitting encrypted insights.
2. **[Intelligent Chain](intelligent_chain.md)** coordinates the secure aggregation of these insights.
3. **[GENOME](genome.md)** evolves based on the aggregated intelligence and redistributes updated knowledge.

This architecture ensures that the global AI grows smarter without ever accessing raw user data.
